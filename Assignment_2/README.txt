ii. Bugs Encountered
	No bugs encountered. Program runs smoothly!

iii. Instructions for running program
	 
	 1. To compile on terminal 
	 	make all
	 
	 2. ./QueryTrees rebase210.txt BST or make run1bst
	    or ./QueryTrees rebase210.txt AVL or make run1bst

	    ./TestTrees <database file name> <queries file name> <flag> or make run2bst
	    E.g.: TestTrees rebase210.txt sequences.txt BST

	    Note that the AvlTree may be tested with make run1avl or make run2avl as well.
	    
	    ./TestRangeQuery <db_file> <key1> <key2>
	    E.g TestRangeQuery rebase210.txt CC\'TCGAGG T\'CCGGA
	 
	 3. make clean
	 	To delete executables and object file type.

iv. Two input file were given, rebase210.txt and sequences.txt
